Testing with tap

Test Structure
- Place tests in test/**/*.spec.js.
- Use the helper to build the app and t.teardown(() => app.close()).
- Prefer app.inject over real network calls.

Coverage
- For each route: test happy path, input validation (400), and boundary cases.
- For OpenAPI: GET /openapi.json must be 200 and validate via @apidevtools/swagger-parser.

Example
- Arrange → Act → Assert; assert statusCode, content-type (JSON), and JSON body shape with t.same or t.match.
