Dependencies and Scripts

Dependencies
- Prefer CommonJS-compatible libs. Avoid ESM-only dependencies unless explicitly approved.
- Keep prod deps lean; devDeps for tooling/tests only.

Scripts
- Maintain: dev, start, test (tap). Add lint when a linter is introduced; do not stub behavior silently.
- When adding tools, wire into scripts with non-interactive flags.
