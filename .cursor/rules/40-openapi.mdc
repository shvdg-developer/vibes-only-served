OpenAPI and Docs

Plugin
- Keep @fastify/swagger registered before routes so tags/paths are captured.
- Serve UI at /docs and JSON at /openapi.json using this.swagger().

Modeling
- Ensure each route has summary, tags, and request/response schemas.
- When adding auth or servers metadata, update src/plugins/swagger.js coherently (no hardcoding environment-specific URLs in code paths).
