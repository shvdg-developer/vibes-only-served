Containerization and Ops

Container
- Base: node:22-alpine. Build with npm ci --omit=dev.
- Copy only needed files (package.json/lock, src/). Run as non-root (USER node).
- Expose 3000. Environment variables are provided at runtime; do not bake secrets.

Health and Readiness
- Keep /healthz and /readyz simple, fast, and without external calls.
- If adding dependencies (DB, queue), keep /readyz reflective of readiness but quick.

Local Dev
- Use npm run dev with nodemon. Production uses npm start.
