Vibes Only Served API – Scope and Style

Scope
- Apply ONLY to files under: 10-app/vibes-only-served/**

Stack Guardrails
- Runtime: Node.js ≥22, Framework: Fastify 5, Language: JavaScript (CommonJS), Testing: tap
- Do not convert to ESM or TypeScript. Keep require/module.exports.
- Do not introduce new frameworks or architectural shifts without explicit request.

Code Style
- Prefer explicit, descriptive names. Use early returns, shallow nesting.
- Use Fastify logger (app.log / request.log), not console.log.
- Avoid reading process.env outside src/config/env.js.
- Keep file structure consistent with README.

Change Hygiene
- When adding endpoints: include JSON Schema, tests, and update README sections (Endpoints/Configuration).
- Keep dependencies minimal; prefer stdlib and current stack.
